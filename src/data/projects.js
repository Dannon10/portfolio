        description: 'LendR is a modern user management dashboard built to simulate a real-world fintech admin system. The application fetches and displays user data from a mock API, enabling structured viewing, pagination, and detailed user records through a clean and responsive dashboard interface. The mock backend was created using a JSON data generator and deployed on Render, allowing the frontend to consume realistic API endpoints similar to a production environment. The dashboard supports paginated user lists and individual user detail views, mirroring how enterprise admin tools handle large datasets. The frontend was built with Next.js and React, written entirely in TypeScript for type safety and maintainability. Styling was handled using SCSS, ensuring a scalable and well-structured design system. The project also includes unit and integration tests written with Jest, improving reliability and validating core functionality such as data fetching and UI rendering. LendR demonstrates strong understanding of frontend architecture, API integration, testing, and dashboard-style application design commonly used in fintech and enterprise platforms.',
